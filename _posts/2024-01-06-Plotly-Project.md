# Plotly Project
As we start 2024 I have picked an interesting data visualisation project prokject to expand my skills.

# Project Overview
To build experience with Plotly Express, Dash, Dash deployment approaches and applied AI integration.

# Goal
To create a reference project for Plotly Data Visualisation.

# The Project

## 1. Build all Plotly Express Graphs
Complete a Notebook with all Plotly express figures and charts:
1. Basics: 
   1. scatter, 
   2. line, 
   3. area, 
   4. bar, 
   5. funnel, 
   6. timeline
2. Part-of-Whole: 
   1. pie, 
   2. sunburst, 
   3. treemap, 
   4. icicle, 
   5. funnel_area
3. 1D Distributions: 
   1. histogram, 
   2. box, 
   3. violin, 
   4. strip, 
   5. ecdf
4. 2D Distributions: 
   1. density_heatmap, 
   2. density_contour
5. atrix or Image Input: 
   1. imshow
6. 3-Dimensional: 
   1. scatter_3d, 
   2. line_3d
7. Multidimensional: 
   1. scatter_matrix, 
   2. parallel_coordinates, 
   3. parallel_categories
8. Tile Maps: 
   1. scatter_mapbox, 
   2. line_mapbox, 
   3. choropleth_mapbox, 
   4. density_mapbox
9. Outline Maps: 
   1. scatter_geo, 
   2. line_geo, 
   3. choropleth
10. Polar Charts: 
    1. scatter_polar, 
    2. line_polar, 
    3. bar_polar
11. Ternary Charts: 
    1. scatter_ternary, 
    2. line_ternary

## 2. Explore the Figure Data Structures
Figures can be represented in Python either as dicts or as instances of the plotly.graph_objects.Figure class, and are serialized as text in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) before being passed to Plotly.js

## 3. Build Sample Dash Apps
Complete a series of exercises cover ing layout and callbacks.

## 4. Deploy Dash App
Deploy Dash App to Huggingface using  Docker.
